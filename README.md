# iFunny-chat-bot
A python chat bot that connects and communicates with iFunny's servers via websocket

Run the StartBot file by entering your email and password in the variables and play around with the example to get a good feel of how it works.

NOTE: Sometimes iFunny may restrict a basic auth token if it has too many logins. If that happens free to open an issue and ask for a newly generated auth token. You can then replace basicauth field in iFunnybot.py class with that new token.
